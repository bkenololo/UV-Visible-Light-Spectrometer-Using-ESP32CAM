This project is made for ITB IEEE 's Sandbox 2.0 Competition in 2024. Me and my team finished as one of the finalist of the competition.
In this project, ESP32CAM is the main component. It acts as a light sensor and data processor as well. Data processing is done by using @kousheekc 's code
https://github.com/kousheekc/DIY-Spectrometer-Analyser and outputs an electromagnetic light-wavelength spectrum.

This project was made over a year ago, I didn't documented it well. I still have a video demonstrating how it works. Here's the link to the video:
